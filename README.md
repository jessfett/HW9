# SQL Homework 9 - Employee Database: A Mystery in Two Parts


## Process
The assignment consisted of analyzing the remaining employee database for Pewlett Hackard for 1980s and 1990s, which includes only 6 CSV files. 


1. Data Modeling/Data Engineering
2. Data Analysis


I analyzed the remaining CSV files and created a relationship database, which can be found in the [Data Folder](https://github.com/jessfett/HW9/tree/master/data). After that, the tables were created in an SQL file using PGAdmin4 and analyzed for the required questions. 

## Data Modeling/Data Engineering

First task was to create an ERD in QuickDBD. 

![ERD - Employees](https://github.com/jessfett/HW9/blob/master/ERD/ERD%20-%20Employees.png)

The tables were created in PGAdmin4. After inspecting the CSV files and creating an ERD, the proper Primary Keys and Foreign Keys were utilized to create tables that were able to be analyzed. 

'''--Drop if existing
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS departments;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS dept_emp;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS dept_manager;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS employees;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS salaries;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS titles; 


--Create neccessary tables
CREATE TABLE "departments" (
	"dept_no" VARCHAR NOT NULL,
	"dept_name" VARCHAR NOT NULL,
	CONSTRAINT "pk_departments" PRIMARY KEY (
	"dept_no"));
	
SELECT * FROM departments;


CREATE TABLE "dept_emp" (
	"emp_no" INT NOT NULL,
	"dept_no" VARCHAR NOT NULL);
	
SELECT * FROM dept_emp;	
	
CREATE TABLE "dept_manager"(
	"dept_no" VARCHAR NOT NULL, 
	"emp_no" INT NOT NULL);

SELECT * FROM dept_manager;
	
CREATE TABLE "employees" (
	"emp_no" INT NOT NULL,
	emp_title_id VARCHAR NOT NULL,
	"birth_date" DATE NOT NULL,
	"first_name" VARCHAR NOT NULL,
	"last_name" VARCHAR NOT NULL,
	"sex" VARCHAR NOT NULL,
	"hire_date" DATE NOT NULL,
	CONSTRAINT "pk_employees" PRIMARY KEY (
		"emp_no"));
		
SELECT * FROM employees;		
		
CREATE TABLE "salaries" (
	"emp_no" INT NOT NULL,
	"salary" INT NOT NULL);

SELECT * FROM salaries; 

CREATE TABLE "titles" (
	"title_id" VARCHAR NOT NULL,
	"title" VARCHAR NOT NULL);
	
SELECT * FROM titles;	
	'''

#### Data Engineering

* Use the information you have to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Remember to specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.

  * For the primary keys check to see if the column is unique, otherwise create a [composite key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_key). Which takes to primary keys in order to uniquely identify a row.
  * Be sure to create tables in the correct order to handle foreign keys.

* Import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table. **Note** be sure to import the data in the same order that the tables were created and account for the headers when importing to avoid errors.

#### Data Analysis

Once you have a complete database, do the following:

1. List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.

2. List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.

3. List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.

4. List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

5. List first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."

6. List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

7. List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

8. In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.

## Bonus (Optional)

As you examine the data, you are overcome with a creeping suspicion that the dataset is fake. You surmise that your boss handed you spurious data in order to test the data engineering skills of a new employee. To confirm your hunch, you decide to take the following steps to generate a visualization of the data, with which you will confront your boss:

1. Import the SQL database into Pandas. (Yes, you could read the CSVs directly in Pandas, but you are, after all, trying to prove your technical mettle.) This step may require some research. Feel free to use the code below to get started. Be sure to make any necessary modifications for your username, password, host, port, and database name:

   ```sql
   from sqlalchemy import create_engine
   engine = create_engine('postgresql://localhost:5432/<your_db_name>')
   connection = engine.connect()
   ```

* Consult [SQLAlchemy documentation](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/engines.html#postgresql) for more information.

* If using a password, do not upload your password to your GitHub repository. See [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uaTPmNvH0I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uaTPmNvH0I) and [https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/ignoring-files](https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/ignoring-files) for more information.

2. Create a histogram to visualize the most common salary ranges for employees.

3. Create a bar chart of average salary by title.

## Epilogue

Evidence in hand, you march into your boss's office and present the visualization. With a sly grin, your boss thanks you for your work. On your way out of the office, you hear the words, "Search your ID number." You look down at your badge to see that your employee ID number is 499942.

## Submission

* Create an image file of your ERD.

* Create a `.sql` file of your table schemata.

* Create a `.sql` file of your queries.

* (Optional) Create a Jupyter Notebook of the bonus analysis.

* Create and upload a repository with the above files to GitHub and post a link on BootCamp Spot.

* Ensure your repository has regular commits (i.e. 20+ commits) and a thorough README.md file
